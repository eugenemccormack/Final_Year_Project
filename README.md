# Final_Year_Project
Collect My Car


What I have learned:

In the beginning, I was going to code my Final Year Project using Dart and Flutter however this has changed to Kotlin as there are far more resources available to me via the internet and other sources. 

In the beginning I was very much apprehensive about coding my project in a new language as this would be adding allot more on my plate. However, over the past few weeks after reading online resources and watching numerous YouTube videos I have found Kotlin to some extent easy to code / understand language as it is a statically typed language. After I felt confident, I downloaded IntelliJ IDEA and practiced some examples / experimented with Kotlin.

I then moved onto starting my Final Year Project via Android Studio. In the beginning Android Studio did not like me coding in Kotlin as I have previously had it configured for Java. I kept getting errors as Android Studio could not recognize some of the Syntax nevertheless, I overcame this problem with the help of my good friends Google and YouTube. It turned out that I was missing Plugins and imports which caused these errors.  

Currently I have a Register / Login created and have this connecting to Firebase excepting the values that are inputted by the user. The Login and Register via Android Studio I found was straightforward as we have been previously taught this and I very much enjoyed this as it is visually rewarding to see instant results. However, connecting Firebase to Android Studio was a complete nightmare due to missing Plugins / SDKâ€™s. I spent the best course of a day configuring and tuning Android Studio to except Firebase Syntax. After reading may forms (whilst disregarding the utter nonsense solutions) and watching may YouTube videos on the process I finally got it to like me.
